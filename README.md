# ML-projects
one of the basic implementation of Machine learning algorithm is classification. calssifying whether a tumor cell is malignant or beningn
In this repo you will find the use of two machine learning algorithm KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) and Logistic Regression to predict the class of breast cancer
The dataset is also mentioned in the repo itself which was first extracted from UCI machine learning repository.
