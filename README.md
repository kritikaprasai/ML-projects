One of the basic implementation of Machine learning algorithm is classification. 
Classifying whether a tumor cell is malignant or beningn is one of its most widely used applcation.
In this repo you will find the use of two machine learning algorithms KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) and Logistic Regression to predict the class of breast cancer.
The dataset is also mentioned in the repo itself which was first extracted from UCI machine learning repository.
